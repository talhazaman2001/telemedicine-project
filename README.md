☁️ Remote patient monitoring and virtual consultation have become increasingly popular, particularly post-pandemic.

However, integrating real-time health data from IoT devices (like heart rate/blood pressure monitors) and providing medical professionals with a streamlined interface is a key challenge.

I designed this architecture to provide a containerised telemedicine platform for patient care, by integrating IoT health monitoring devices, real-time analytics, machine learning tools and blue-green CI/CD workflows. This system is built for cost-optimisation, scalability and agility.
